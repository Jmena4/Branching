## Branching Notes

This will list ways to create and manage branches.

`git branch` - list branches you have locally, and highlight the one your're using

`git branch BRANCH_NAME` - creates a new branch called BRANCH_NAME

`git checkout BRANCH_NAME` - switches to that branch

`git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME` - creates AND switches to the branch

Be careful of master getting ahead of branch

`git branch -d BRANCH_NAME` - delete a branch locally
